## Word Puzzle Generator 2 \(First Submitted by Dr\. John A\. Nyhart\)


</div>

### Description

Generates "Word Search" puzzles with ease. Original code by Dr. John A. Nyhart. I added a better printing function and a few other bells and whistles. All credit should still go to him.
 
### More Info
 
First off, this is not all of my code. I just added a better printing function to the existing code offered by Dr. John A. Nyhart. He was nice enough to post this great code for us, and I just wanted to make it a little better. All votes and credits should still go to him.
